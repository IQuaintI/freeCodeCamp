          Learning land navigation seems like a strange thing to do in a world
          where we have pinpoint accurate <code>GPS</code> only a few taps away,
          but there is still something to be said for the old-school ways of
          doing things. You will not always have signal, or battery life, or
          even electronics on you, but you will always have your wits about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <code>map</code> is a graphic representation of the Earth's surface
          drawn to scale from an overhead view. If that sounded complicated do
          not worry. This technical document will go over some of the basics of
          land navigation.

          The only things you need to be successful at land navigation are a
          <code>map</code>, a <code>compass</code>, a writing utensil, and some
          luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want any more information on land navigation Army Field
          Manual/Training Circular (FM/TC) 3-25.26 covers everything you will
          ever need to know regarding the matter.

          Ever wonder what all those colors on a <code>map</code> mean? Well
          have no fear as the following will hopefully answer every question you
          had on the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Red represents cultural features such as populated areas, roads, and
          boundaries. However, this color is only found on older maps as it has
          been superseded by the red-brown color.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The spirit of arrogance most definitely makes you shine. It paints a
          bright red target on your own forehead.” ― Criss Jami

      <!-- Brown -->
      <section id="Brown" class="main-section">
        <header>Brown</header>
        <p>
          Brown is next up on our color wheel and it represents all relief
          features (this is just a fancy way of saying terrain), differences in
          elevation through contour lines, cultivated land and is readable when
          using a red-light.
        </p>
        <p>This color is also used more so on older maps.</p>
        <p>
          “The color brown, I realized, is anything but nondescript. It comes in
          as many hues as there are colors of earth, with is commonly presumed
          infinite.” ― Barbara Kingsolver
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contour lines</li>
          <li>Cultivated land</li>
          <li>Readable under red light</li>
          <li>Terrain features</li>
          <li>Elevation differences</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Red-Brown -->
      <section id="Red-Brown" class="main-section">
        <header>Red-Brown</header>
        <p>
          A mixture of two colors that exist to identify cultural features
          (human-made features), relief features, non-surveyed elevations, and
          surveyed elevations.
        </p>
        <p>Can be seen on red-light friendly maps</p>

          Makes note of vegetation that carries military significance such as
          woods, orchards, and vineyards.
        </p>
        <p>Maps tend to have a lot of this.</p>

          “If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, doesn't
          it just lie there and rot?” ― Chuck Palahniuk

      <section id="Blue" class="main-section">
        <header>Blue</header>
        <p>
          This color represents hydrography (measuring the physical features of
          water) or other water features such as lakes, swamps, rivers, and
          drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that while maps can show how big a body of water is, it does not
          accurately portray depth.
        </p>

          Identifies man-made features such as buildings, roads, surveyed spots
          and all labels.
        </p>
        <p>
          This color is similar to red-brown but cannot be seen with a
          red-light.
